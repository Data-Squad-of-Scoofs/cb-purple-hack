# ***How to interact with LLM?***

Starting the server:
1. Launch the server in LM Studio
2. ```choco install ngrok```
3. ```ngrok config add-authtoken [authtoken]```
4. ```ngrok http --domain=live-relaxed-oryx.ngrok-free.app 1234 ```

# ***How to interact with the database?***

We implemented various options. Eventually, ClickHouse was chosen.

## 1. ChromaDB

Launching the database in docker:
```
docker pull chromadb/chroma
docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```

Connecting:

```
pip install chromadb
self.client = chromadb.HttpClient(host=your_ip, port=your_port)
```

## 2. ClickHouse

The database was launched via clickhouse.cloud, but it can also be launched via docker.
It operates faster than ChromaDB.

Connecting:

```
pip install clickhouse_connect
client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host=your_ip, port=your_port, username=your_user_name, password=your_password)
```
